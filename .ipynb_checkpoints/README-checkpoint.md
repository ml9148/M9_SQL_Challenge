# M9_SQL_Challenge
Module 9 - SQL Challenge

In this challenge we are starting to use SQL, a server is created for it and it created a relational DataBase combining data from 6 different .CSV files.

Each file had different sets of data:
    1) Departments
    2) Dept_Emp
    3) Dept_Manager
    4) Employees
    5) Salaries
    6) Titles

By setting Primary Keys and Foreign Keys all the different data sets have been combined to be able to provide answers to the following questions:

    1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
    2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
    3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
    4) List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    5) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
    6) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
    7) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    8) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

Very good first exercize.
